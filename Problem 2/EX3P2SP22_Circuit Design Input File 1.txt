# Lines starting with a # character are comments to be ignored
# You may have comment lines anywhere in the file

# blank lines are also allowed and will be ignored

# Other lines in the file are identified by specific KEYWORDS, followed by data
# KEYWORDS may include Capital letters, but capitalization must not be required
# each line stands alone, and there is no required ORDER to the file
